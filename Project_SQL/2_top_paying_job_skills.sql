Key insights from skill analysis:
- SQL (8) is the top-required skill, essential for 80% of roles.
- Python (7) and Tableau (6) are highly valued, emphasizing programming and data visualization.
- R (4) remains relevant for advanced statistical analysis.
- Cloud and data tools, such as Snowflake (3), Azure (2), and AWS (2), show demand for modern data infrastructure skills.
- Python libraries like Pandas (3) and Numpy (2) highlight the importance of data manipulation.
- Excel (3) is still widely used, even in top-paying roles.
- Collaboration tools (Bitbucket, GitLab, Confluence, Jira â€” all with 2 mentions each) underscore the need for teamwork and agile practices.
